**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to identify common branch naming conventions.

## Best practice branch naming conventions

Ideally, branch names should be descriptive and follow a consistent format. Here are some common branch naming conventions:

- `dev`: Used for the main development branch.
- `feature/`: Used for new features or enhancements.
- `bugfix/`: Used for bug fixes.
- `hotfix/`: Used for critical bug fixes that need to be deployed immediately.
- `refactor/`: Used for refactoring code.
- `release/`: Used for preparing a new release.
- `docs/`: Used for documentation changes.
- `test/`: Used for adding or modifying tests.
- `chore/`: Used for miscellaneous tasks or maintenance.

By following a consistent naming convention, you can easily identify the purpose of each branch and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

> ðŸ§  Branches like `feature/sign-in`, `bugfix/home-page-error`, and `refactor/cat-show-component` use the naming convention to the fullest potential.

## Best practice branch naming conventions with collaborators

> ðŸ’¡ When using the collaborator method, you'd still add your indentifier to the start of the branch name, making the full name of our examples above soemthing like: `<identifier>/feature/sign-in`, `<identifier>/bugfix/home-page-error`, and `<identifier>/refactor/cat-show-component`.
