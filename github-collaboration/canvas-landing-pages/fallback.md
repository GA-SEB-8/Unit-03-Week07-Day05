## About

In this module, students will practice GitHub collaboration techniques essential for contributing to team projects. They will learn the basics of forking and cloning repositories, managing branches, handling pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts. By the end of this module, students will be proficient in using GitHub to efficiently collaborate and contribute to shared projects.

## Content

This lecture content is divided into two methods of GitHub collaboration:

- Collaborator method
- Fork method

You may explore both of these methods or just choose a single path. Your instructor will guide you on how to interact with this content and communicate to you which path you'll take. Regardless of the path you take, start with the following concepts lecture.

| Lesson                            | Skills                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Concepts](../concepts/README.md) | Understand why GitHub is used to collaborate. |

After you've completed that, move into one of the methods below.
