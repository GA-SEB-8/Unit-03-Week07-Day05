**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to fork and clone a repository from GitHub.

## Forking

Forking on GitHub makes a copy of a repository from one GitHub account to a different GitHub account while retaining the connection between the two copies. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and contribute to the original repo. Forking is commonly used when you want to contribute to an open-source project, work on a team project, or experiment with someone else's code.

> üí° Think of repositories as folders. Forking is like making a copy of a folder on your computer. You can make changes to the copy without affecting the original folder. Forking is a powerful feature that enables collaboration, experimentation, and learning.

After you've been a collaborator on a project as a ***programmer***, you will likely want to keep a copy of that work for yourself. Right now, all of your code on GitHub is held in a single repo owned by a single person (the ***GitHub manager***). By forking the GitHub manager's remote repo on GitHub, you'll have a copy that you own and control the destiny of.

> üö® While technically possible, it would be very confusing to use both the collaborator method and the forking method at the same time while you are actively contributing to a project. If you've been using the collaborator method, you will likely only want to fork a project after you finish your planned contributions.
>
> That said, after forking, it's still possible to collaborate and sync your code with your teammates if you do return to this project later. Check out the rest of the fork method guides for details.

### Forking a repo (***programmers***)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only ***programmers*** should complete this task.

Forking can be done on any GitHub repository that allows it by following these steps.

1. **Navigate to the repository**: The GitHub manager on your team should have already sent you a URL to access the ***GitHub manager's remote repo***. Open your browser and navigate there now.

2. **Fork the repo**: Select the **Fork** button near the top right corner of the page, as indicated by the red outline below.

   ![Screenshot of the GitHub repository page for 'github-collaboration'. In the top right, the 'Fork' button is outlined in red.](../fork-method-forking/assets/repo-fork.png)

3. **Choose where to create the fork**: You'll be taken to a **Create a new fork** page. From here, ensure you are the owner of the repo in the dropdown outlined in red, and then select the **Create fork** button outlined towards the bottom of the page. Typically, when you fork a repo, you'll create the fork in your personal account and give it the same name as the original repo, as shown below.

   ![Screenshot of the GitHub 'Create a new fork' page for the repository 'github-collaboration' under the 'GA-Student' account. The 'Owner' field is outlined in red and is set to 'ga-collaborator' and the 'Repository name' field is pre-filled with 'github-collaboration'. There is a green checkmark indicating that the repository name is available. The 'Copy the main branch only' checkbox is selected. At the bottom right, the 'Create fork' button is outlined in red.](../fork-method-forking/assets/create-fork.png)

After completing the above steps, you'll be taken to the forked repo on your account. Throughout this lecture, we'll refer to this repo as the ***programmer's remote repo***. Note the **forked from** text outlined in red below, indicating that this repo was forked from another repo (the ***GitHub manager's remote repo***).

Note each programmer can have their own remote repo - you'll only work in your own.

You forked the GitHub manager's repo! üéâ Now, let's clone it down.

### Cloning a forked repo (***programmers***)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only ***programmers*** should complete this task.

We copied the `github-collaboration` repo from one GitHub account to another by forking it. The next step is to clone the forked copy (the ***programmer's remote repo***) to your local device. This process isn't any different from cloning a repo that wasn't forked.

![Fork & clone diagram](../fork-method-forking/assets/fork-clone.png)

Open your Terminal application and navigate to a directory of your choice:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Since you previously collaborated on a project with the same name, you should ensure that you clone the new repo to a distinct location that you won't confuse with the collaborator version of this project. Good organization reduces confusion and makes it easier to come back to this work later.

Clone the ***programmer's remote repo*** to your device. Your GitHub username should be present in the URL used in the `git clone` command, like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-collaboration.git
```

Replacing `<your-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) with your GitHub username.

Enter the new `github-collaboration` directory. We'll refer to this as the ***programmer's local repo***.

```bash
cd github-collaboration
```

Finally, open it in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

## How are forking and cloning different?

- Forking creates a copy of a repository in your **GitHub account**. This repository is the ***programmer's remote repo***.
- Cloning downloads a repository from GitHub to your **local machine**, enabling you to work on the code. This repository is the ***programmer's local repo***.

While forking and cloning are typically done in sequence, it's important to understand that they serve different purposes. You can fork a repository without cloning it, and you can clone a repository without forking it.

> üß† Repository owners can control whether others can fork and clone their repositories. Some repositories may not allow forking or cloning.
