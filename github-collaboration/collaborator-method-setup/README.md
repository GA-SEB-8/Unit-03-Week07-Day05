## Setup

In this lecture, your instructor and a partner they've chosen will demo the GitHub collaboration workflow, and then you'll get the chance to do it all again yourself with a small team.

Before you begin collaborating, you will want to determine who will fill the following roles on your team:

- Programmer
- GitHub manager

Programmers will not manage the GitHub repo for the project but will contribute code to the repo.

GitHub managers will manage the project's GitHub repo while also contributing their own code to the repo.

For this activity, you should designate a single GitHub manager. This will help maintain a clear division of labor and avoid confusion about who is responsible for what task. Any other collaborators will fill the programmer role. In a larger project, you may designate multiple GitHub managers.

### Create a GitHub repository (***GitHub managers***)

> ⚠️ Only ***GitHub managers*** should complete this task.

Create a new ***public*** repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `github-collaboration`. ***Important***: as you create it, initialize the repository by adding a README file.

Do not clone this repository.

### Send the GitHub manager your GitHub username (***programmers***)

> ⚠️ Only ***programmers*** should complete this task.

Send your GitHub manager your GitHub username. They will need this information to complete a later step.
