## What's included?

There are two tracks you may take for this project depending on your preferences - A group version and and individual version.

This is the repo for the group version and includes:

- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Journey
- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Requirements
- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Individual Contributor Requirements
- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Details
- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Deliverables (students submit links to project planning materials, a front-end and back-end GitHub repo, and a deployed app throughout project week)
- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Feedback [in Canvas only]
- MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project Individual Contributor Feedback [in Canvas only]

## How to use group project content

Students should be presented with and held to the standards of both the project requirements as a group and the individual contributor requirements individually.

A group may pass their project as a whole, but individuals within that group may fail. This helps to ensure individuals in a group are not just motivated to deliver a project that meets the requirements, but also to be meaningful contributors to the project as a whole.

### Group deliverables (Canvas only)

Only one person per group needs to submit deliverables into the Project Delverables assignment in Canvas. To enable this, you will need to use Canvas to construct an assignment group for this project. Use the same groups for project feedback rubric as well. All students will receive individual feedback through the project individual contributor feedback rubric.

## Customizing your project week

Customize your project week by adding to the existing project documentation. Existing content should not be changed, but you may remove it if there are direct conflicts with your customizations. Ensure you're still providing students with enough background information to succeed during project week if you do this.

You should not add, remove, or alter any project requirements.

The MERN Stack CRUD App Project Details page provides some basic background information for the project. Sensible defaults are provided here, but you may want to add some details on top of what this document provides to match how you'd like to structure your project week for your students.

Some existing items already covered in this document that you may want to expand on include:

- Some helpful tips to get started.
- Details on how you will provide project assistance
- Level Up ideas for students after they have completed their projects.
- Presentation details such as the time allotted for presentations and suggested topics for students to cover during their presentations.

You may also want to make additions, such as:

- Examples of suitable planning materials.
- Examples of previous student projects.
- Schedule considerations such as any bonus lectures or stand-ups.

You may also want to make changes to the planning materials students submit and the app they use to build them. For this project, students will build their planning materials using Trello by default. If you'd prefer something different, you'll need to create new Project Planning Deliverable documents.

When making additions, avoid overwhelming students with irrelevant or unhelpful details. These documents are already dense for learners, so try not to go overboard by adding too much information.

### Customizing deliverables

Some instructors may want to split the project deliverable into multiple parts to give each item its own due date or to ease data collection. Individual/coupled deliverable pages exist in this content and do not need to be created. These can be found at:

**Individual**:

- [Project Planning Deliverable](../project-planning-deliverable/README.md)
- [Project GitHub Repo Link Deliverable - Front-end](../project-github-repo-link-deliverable-front-end/README.md)
- [Project GitHub Repo Link Deliverable - Back-end](../project-github-repo-link-deliverable-back-end/README.md)
- [Project Deployed App Link Deliverable](../project-deployed-app-link-deliverable/README.md)

**Coupled**:

- [Project Planning and GitHub Repo Links Deliverable](../project-planning-and-github-repo-links-deliverable/README.md)
- [Project GitHub Repo Links Deliverable](../project-github-repo-links-deliverable/README.md)
- [Project GitHub Repo and Deployed App Links Deliverable](../project-github-repo-and-deployed-app-links-deliverable/)

## Notes for maintainers

Edits to project requirements are complex and should be made thoughtfully. When requirements change, alterations need to be made uniformly to the following documents/resources:

- [Project Requirements Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1askuVBSGfN6M68ls8TVW6lkZWz35u11mnUiAHor-BlQ/edit#gid=696206981).
- [Project Requirements PDF](../project-requirements/assets/project-requirements.pdf) (built from the Project Requirements document in Google Sheets).
- [Project Requirements document served in GitHub Pages](../project-requirements/README.md).
- All MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project rubrics in Canvas.
