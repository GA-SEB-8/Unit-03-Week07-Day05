## GitHub repo deliverables

After your project proposal has been approved, your team will need to designate someone to set up the two main GitHub repos for your project - one for the front-end and another for the back-end.

> ðŸš¨ As a reminder, you should use the same front-end and back-end repos or keep all the repos you use for the entire duration of your project to meet the project requirements.

## Deployed app deliverable

During project week, your team will deploy the project so that others are able to use it on the internet! The back-end and front-end applications will be deployed separately.

Follow the [MEN Stack Deployment guide](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/universal-resources/deployment/men-stack-deployment/) to deploy your back-end MEN Stack application.

Follow the [React Front-End Deployment guide](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/universal-resources/deployment/react-front-end-deployment/) to deploy your front-end React application.
