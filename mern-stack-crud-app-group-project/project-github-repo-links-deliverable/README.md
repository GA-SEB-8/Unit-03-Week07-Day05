## GitHub repo deliverables

After your project proposal has been approved, your team will need to designate someone to set up the two main GitHub repos for your project - one for the front-end and another for the back-end.

> ðŸš¨ As a reminder, you should use the same front-end and back-end repos or keep all the repos you use for the entire duration of your project to meet the project requirements.

## Submitting your deliverables

Follow the guidelines below to submit your deliverables for this project.

### Submitting your GitHub repo links

Your team will submit a single link to the main ***public*** GitHub repos that you are using for the front-end and back-end of your MERN Stack CRUD App Group Project below in the following format:

```plaintext
Front-end GitHub repo link: <link>
Back-end GitHub repo link: <link>
```

Replacing `<link>` (including the `<` and `>`) with a link to your front-end and back-end GitHub repos.
